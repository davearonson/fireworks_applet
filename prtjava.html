<h1>Dave Aronson's Java Demo</h1>

<p><hr>

<p class="di">This is an applet called fireshow, a simple fireworks display:

<p>
<center>
<applet code=fireshow.class width=800 height=600>
<param name=delay value=3>
<param name=framesPerSec value=40>
</applet>
</center>

<p class="di">The code is in these files:

<p><ul>
 <li><a href="fireshow.java">fireshow.java</a> -- the applet itself.
 <li><a href="firework.java">firework.java</a> -- various classes of fireworks.
 <li><a href="projectile.java">projectile.java</a> -- various basic classes of projectiles.
 <li><a href="dja.java">dja.java</a> -- various utility methods and constants.
</ul>

<p class="di">In addition to demonstrating inheritance, this applet also
demonstrates threading.  I initially had each projectile run as its own thread,
but that was very slow.  Now it has one thread occasionally launch a rocket,
while another thread handles all the existing projectiles (erasing, moving, and
if not expired, redrawing), which are stored in a Vector.  Admittedly, this
application does not really <i>require</i> threading, and would be simpler
without it, plus it doesn't do proper synchronization, but that's not the
point!
